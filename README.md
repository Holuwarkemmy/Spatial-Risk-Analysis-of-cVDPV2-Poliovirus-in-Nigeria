# Spatial-Risk-Analysis-of-cVDPV2-Poliovirus-in-Nigeri


## Project Overview
This report presents a **spatial epidemiological analysis** of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria, conducted at **Local Government Area (LGA) level**.  
The project integrates surveillance data and population density to support **risk-based prioritisation** for polio eradication efforts.

The analysis demonstrates how **GIS and data visualisation** can serve as practical decision-support tools for **immunisation planning, surveillance strengthening, and resource allocation**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Despite significant progress in polio eradication, cVDPV2 continues to circulate in parts of Nigeria due to:
- Immunisation gaps  
- Population concentration  
- Localised transmission dynamics  

Traditional tabular reporting limits the ability to identify **geographic hotspots and priority intervention areas**. This project addresses that challenge using spatial analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Aggregate ward-level cVDPV2 case data to LGA level  
- Integrate population density as a proxy for transmission potential  
- Develop a **composite risk index** for cVDPV2  
- Identify **high-priority LGAs** for targeted interventions  
- Communicate findings through an **interactive dashboard**

---

## 🗂️ Data & Methods

### Data Sources
- Ward-level cVDPV2 surveillance data  
- Nigeria LGA administrative boundary shapefile  
- Population density raster dataset  

### Methods
- Spatial joins and ward-to-LGA aggregation  
- Zonal statistics to extract mean population density per LGA  
- Risk scoring and classification (Very Low → Very High Risk)  
- Interactive dashboard development using Power BI  

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- cVDPV2 risk is **spatially clustered**, not randomly distributed  
- A small number of LGAs account for a **disproportionate share of overall risk**  
- High population density significantly increases transmission potential  
- Risk-based targeting can improve the efficiency of immunisation and surveillance activities  

---

## 🏥 Public Health Relevance
This analysis supports:
- Targeted **Supplementary Immunisation Activities (SIAs)**  
- Improved **surveillance prioritisation and early warning**  
- Evidence-based **resource allocation**  
- Routine monitoring of evolving transmission risk  

The methodology is **scalable and transferable** to other vaccine-preventable and infectious diseases.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **QGIS**: spatial analysis, aggregation, zonal statistics  
- **Power BI**: interactive dashboards, maps, ranking  
- Spatial epidemiology  
- Public health data analytics  
- GIS-driven decision support  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Lack of WASH and immunisation coverage data  
- Surveillance data quality dependent on reporting completeness  
- Population density used as a proxy rather than direct transmission metrics  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project highlights the value of **simple, transparent spatial analytics** in strengthening disease control programmes.  
By translating surveillance data into actionable geographic insights, it supports more **efficient, targeted, and impactful public health interventions**.
